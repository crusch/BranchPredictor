//Should test:
//Is predictor making predictions and is it correct? 5th run through of jumps up there should be much faster
//because predictor should predict taken. Same applies to the loop that initializes r4 to hold a halt instruction. 
//Does predictor recover from bad predictions? With self modifying code, the jumps at pc = 3 through pc = 7 will be overwritten with stores. The predictor might have history for those pcs 
//and try to predict that they will be taken jumps even though they are now stores (and one halt). 
//Will the predictor recover appropriately?
